    "# Problem 5 - QRAM \n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of us have heard about Random Access Memory (RAM). It is one of the most important components of a computer system which allows *stored information processing*. A computer's CPU directly interacts with RAM to access and process information. \n",
    "\n",
    "A property for data which is present in RAM is that it will have an **address** and a **value**. These properties are essential for the common operations which are required for data storage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'resources/problem-5/ram-vector.jpg' width = 50%>\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all fine but how do we define the concept of **memory** in quantum computing? How do you represent data in quantum bits? Let's constrain ourselves to the simple concept of arrays and see how we may store an array into qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Each element **value** needs to be encoded into some qubits and there needs to be some notion of **indexing** present with our encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "While a classical RAM would encode the data into bits, a **qRAM** would encode the data into a quantum state like the following - \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\Psi \\rangle = \\frac{|0\\rangle V_0|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} + |1\\rangle V_1|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} + |2\\rangle V_2|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} + |3\\rangle V_3|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}}{\\sqrt{4}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can have two registers - one for the **indexing** and one for the **storage**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first *ket* represents the **index qubits**. The numbers $0,1,2,3$ are indices and written in shorthand decimal format. Actually, the quantum state in the binary format they would be something like - \n",
    "    $$ |2\\rangle \\equiv |10\\rangle $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "The operator $V_i$ represents the operator which would encode the $i^{th}$ value of the array into the **value qubits**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second *ket* represents the **value qubits**. These qubits would store the values of the array elements. Note that the number of qubits, $n$ would be - \n",
    "    $$ n = \\lfloor log_2(m) \\rfloor + 1$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ represents the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions) and $m$ is the maximum value available in the array. In the above example, $m$ would be just $6$ and we could use $3$ qubits for the value qubits. Note that value qubits are also encoded in the *binary* format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the complete **qRAM** state for the array `[3, 4, 5, 6]` would be - \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\Psi \\rangle = \\frac{|00\\rangle |011\\rangle + |01\\rangle |100\\rangle + |10\\rangle |101\\rangle + |11\\rangle |110\\rangle}{\\sqrt{4}}$$"
